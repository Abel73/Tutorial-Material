    + For Windows: go to https://gitforwindows.org/, hit "Download" and install it using default setting
    + For Mac: 
      
      * 1) Step 1 - Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
        - I recommand you to install Homebrew first, it would make your coding life more easier: 
        - Copy & paste the following into the terminal window and hit Return
          ```  
          /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
          ```  
        - You will be offered to install the Command Line Developer Tools from Apple. Confirm by clicking Install. After the installation finished, continue installing Homebrew by hitting Return again
      
      * 2) Step 2 â€“ Install Git:
        - Copy & paste the following into the terminal window and hit Return
          ```  
          brew install git
          ```  

#### Anaconda (for Python, Jupyter Notebook, R, Java and more)
  * Conda installation
    - [History Installers link](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/)
    - Which Version to install? Choose Anaconda3 instead of Anaconda2!
    - Highly recommend to install Python 3.6 version or above.
    - I'll use the "Anaconda3-2019.03" version throughout this semester
      + For 64-bit Mac, try https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
